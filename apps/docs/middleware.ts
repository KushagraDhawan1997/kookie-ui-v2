/**
 * The canonical URL answers in markdown when a client asks for markdown (2026-09-07, §47).
 *
 * The twin has been served at `<path>.md` since 2026-09-06, which requires the caller to know
 * our spelling. `Accept` is the platform's own way to ask, and this is the seam where the
 * question gets answered: a rewrite onto the twin's existing route, so there is one body and
 * one `markdownFor()` rather than a second renderer that agrees.
 *
 * TWO HEADERS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM SURVIVES ON THE HTML BRANCH (2026-09-07, the audit).
 *
 * Both are set here. The `Link` naming the alternate reaches the wire on every page, so a
 * client that would rather fetch the twin directly can find it without being told the
 * convention — the same job `llms.txt` does for the site as a whole, one page at a time.
 *
 * `Vary: Accept` reaches the wire on the NEGOTIATED branch and not on the other one. Next's App
 * Router writes its own `Vary: rsc, next-router-state-tree, …, Accept-Encoding` over whatever a
 * response carries, and it does so after both this file and `next.config.ts`'s `headers()` have
 * had their turn — measured with `curl -I` against a restarted dev server, with a probe header
 * proving `headers()` ran and its `Vary` still lost. There is no third place to set it short of
 * a custom server.
 *
 * WHAT THAT COSTS, stated rather than glossed: a shared cache can store the HTML for this URL
 * without knowing the response varies, and later hand that HTML to a client that asked for
 * markdown. It cannot do the reverse — the markdown response DOES carry `Vary: Accept` — so the
 * failure is an agent receiving a page it can still read, and the `Link` header on it names the
 * twin. The dangerous direction, a person receiving a markdown file, is the one that is closed.
 * `negotiate.test.ts` reads both branches off a real response rather than off this function's
 * return value, which is what makes the claim above checkable instead of hopeful.
 *
 * THE MATCHER IS AUTHORED, and it has to be: Next statically analyses this object at build
 * time, so a list derived from `PAGES` would be read as no list at all. It cannot import
 * `PAGES` either — that module reaches the filesystem and every chapter's compiled MDX. So the
 * shape of a page URL is written here and a law compiles this exact array against `PAGES`,
 * which is what makes a new section fail CI rather than quietly lose its twin.
 *
 * Every path this site serves a twin for is two segments: a chapter carries its section
 * (`start/installation`), and components and blocks carry theirs. The dot exclusion keeps
 * `/components/button.md` out — middleware runs BEFORE `next.config.ts`'s rewrites, so the
 * twin's own URL arrives here first and must be left to the route it already has.
