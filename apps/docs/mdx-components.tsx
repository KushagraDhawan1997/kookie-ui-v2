/**
 * Markdown, resolved into KookieUI (2026-08-21).
 *
 * This file is the whole reason the docs can use a compiler without using a framework: MDX
 * hands over an element name, and every answer here is a component from the package. A `##`
 * is a `<Heading>` on the house ladder (§15: page 8, section 7, subsection 6), a paragraph is
 * `<Text>` at the reading step, a fence is the same `CodeSample` the component pages use, a
 * rule is a `<Separator>`. Nothing in a chapter can paint a colour or invent a distance,
 * because a chapter has no vocabulary for either.
 *
 * VERTICAL RHYTHM IS THE CALLER'S, and it has to be: components never own outer spacing (the
 * non-negotiable). The chapter page puts the whole flow in a `<Stack>`, so the base distance
 * between blocks is that gap; a heading adds to it through `<Box mt>`, the sanctioned escape.
 *
 * THE RHYTHM IS STATED, because until 2026-08-25 it was not. Measured on a chapter, this file
 * produced ONE distance doing four jobs: paragraph to paragraph 12px, paragraph to code block
 * 12px, and heading to its own body 12px. A 12px gap under a 24px line is half a line, so
 * paragraphs fused into a wall and a fence read as another paragraph. Only the 36px above an
 * `h2` was differentiated at all. Differentiated rhythm is the composition brief's own rule
 * (§15) — within-group and between-group must differ by at least two layout-space steps — so
 * the renderer that publishes that rule was the one screen on the site breaking it.
 *
 * Four intervals now, each meaning exactly one thing, and each landing ON a layout-space step
 * rather than between two (`mt` composes with the flow gap, so the sum is what the eye reads):
 *
 *   sibling to sibling      16  (`FLOW_GAP` alone)          — two thirds of the 24px line
 *   heading to its body     16  (`FLOW_GAP` alone)          — a heading belongs to what follows
 *   figure, top and bottom  32  (`FIGURE_MARGIN` + gap)     — a fence is not another paragraph
 *   subsection break (h3)   40  (`mt="6"` + gap)
 *   section break (h2)      48  (`mt="7"` + gap)
 *
 * Heading space is asymmetric by 3:1, which is the brief's rule and the reason a section break
 * now reads as one instead of as a slightly larger paragraph gap.
 *
 * THE MEASURE IS SPLIT FROM THE FIGURE WIDTH, and that split is what buys both halves. Prose
 * ran 93 characters per line, measured — against a 45–75 ideal and an 80 ceiling anything
 * technical is usually granted. Narrowing the whole column would have cramped every code
 * sample, so `prose.css` gives text `--kd-measure` (40rem, measured at 80 characters) and lets
 * a figure keep the column. They share a left edge, so there is still one axis; only the right
 * edge differs, which is the arrangement HIG and Material both use for the same reason.
 *
 * ONE ELEMENT HAS NO COMPONENT TO RESOLVE TO — the list — and it is handled here in the only
 * honest way: the semantic element, kept for what it announces, with its type coming from
 * `<Text render>` and its remaining details from `prose.css` in tokens. Nothing in the system
 * has ever named a list. Writing the docs is what turned that from an absence nobody had
 * noticed into three recorded gaps (LOG 2026-08-21), which is the pattern this repo keeps
 * having: /preview forced the composition rules, the builder forced `componentAxes`, and the
 * canon forced the prose primitives — `Link` shipped as a result, and the static `Table`
 * followed 2026-08-31 (§36), taking the hand-drawn `.kd-table` rules with it.
