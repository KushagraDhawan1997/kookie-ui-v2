/**
 * The site footer: a mark, columns of links, and the line at the bottom (2026-09-01).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A BLOCK AND NOT A COMPONENT. A footer is a POSITION — the last region of a page
 * — and §3 is that a component never owns where it sits. Its substance is entirely the app's
 * (which links, which words, which mark), and §11 has no row for it. What is left for the
 * system to own is an arrangement and a piece of wiring, which is exactly what a copied file
 * carries safely: every colour, distance and step below resolves through the package, so the
 * center stays in the dependency and this file holds only the shape.
 *
 * IT IS DATA-DRIVEN, AND THAT IS THE DECISION. v1 shipped a footer as thirteen exports —
 * `Root`, `Main`, `Bottom`, `Brand`, `BrandName`, `Tagline`, `Links`, `LinkGroup`, `Nav`,
 * `Link`, `Legal`, `Social`, `SocialLink` — of which eleven were a `Flex` or a `Text` with
 * different defaults. That is layout wearing a part's name, and this repo has refused it twice
 * by name (`ComposerRow`'s grouping, 2026-08-23; `BreadcrumbSeparator`, 2026-09-01). A column
 * of links is a LIST, and a list is a prop: `groups` says what the footer says, and the file
 * you are reading says how it looks. Nothing is expressible through thirteen wrappers that is
 * not expressible by editing this one.
 *
 * WHAT IT ACTUALLY OWNS is the naming: each column is its own `<nav>` named by its own title
 * through `aria-labelledby`, so a screen reader announces "Support navigation" rather than
 * five unnamed navigation regions in a row. That is a spec rather than a taste, and a spec
 * copied by hand rots — the argument `Field` makes for owning its label wiring and `Tree`
 * makes for owning its keyboard.
 *
 * THE COLUMN TITLE IS NOT A HEADING, and the refusal is deliberate. A heading is a section of
 * the DOCUMENT, and a footer's column title is a label for a navigation region — putting it in
 * the outline makes page furniture compete with the page's own structure, which on a chapter
 * would put "Support" beside the chapter's real sections. The region is named, which is the
 * half that carries the meaning; `aria-labelledby` needs an id, not an `<h2>`.
 *
 * REFUSED, each for a reason the system already states:
 *
 *  - **Social icons.** §8 ships no icon set, so a written one would export an import the
 *    reader's app cannot resolve (the builder's own refusal). A "Follow us" group of links is
 *    the same information, and it is what the references do.
 *  - **A newsletter form.** It needs an endpoint, which is an app's, and a `Field` plus a
 *    `Button` is four lines in a file you own. Giving it a seat here would mean designing a
 *    position for something the system cannot fill.
 *  - **Payment marks and logos.** Images the app owns. `brand` takes a node for the same
 *    reason: the mark is yours.
 *  - **Axis props.** No `size`, no `tone`, no `emphasis`. A block is not a component with an
 *    API to grow — the steps are stated once, below, and if you want other steps you change
 *    them in your copy. That is the whole difference between this and the package.
 *
 * IT DRAWS NO PANE AT ALL, and that is a refusal rather than a default (2026-09-01, Kushagra:
 * "I dont think any footer block should have Surface as part of the block, that is up to the
 * user, its easy to compose").
 *
 * It shipped as a `Surface`, then for an hour as a `pane` boolean when the second consumer
 * wanted the other answer — and the boolean was the wrong repair. What a footer sits ON is the
 * page's business, which is §3's own sentence about a component never owning where it sits,
 * said one level up: a footer that wants a ground is `<Surface><Footer/></Surface>`, one
 * element at the call site rather than a prop and a branch in here. Every consumer keeps the
 * choice and this file keeps none of it.
 *
 * A FOOTER WITH NO COLUMNS IS A LINE, and it is DERIVED rather than asked for (2026-09-02).
 * The minimal footer — a mark, two or three destinations, a copyright, all on one row — is the
 * second composition that actually recurs in the wild, and it is not a different arrangement so
 * much as this one with nothing to stack: there are no columns, so the mark has nothing to sit
 * above, and leaving it there draws a title over an empty region. So when `groups` is empty the
 * mark joins the sign-off row, and everything else about that row is unchanged — the note keeps
 * the start wall and the legal links keep the end. One `groups.length` reads it, and no call
 * site has to know which footer it is asking for.
 *
 * WHICH IS ALSO WHY THERE IS NO `brand` PLACEMENT PROP, and the mark-beside-the-columns shape
 * every second product site draws is not reachable from this file. It is a taste, not a
 * derivation — and the moment a demo on this block's page shows an arrangement the file cannot
 * produce, the copy button hands over something that does not make the picture. If you want the
 * mark beside the columns, that is a `Flex` around two children in your copy, which is the same
 * answer this file gives about steps and colours.
