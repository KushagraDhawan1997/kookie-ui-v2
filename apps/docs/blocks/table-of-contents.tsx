/**
 * The table of contents: the headings of the page you are reading, with the one you are at
 * marked (2026-09-04).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A BLOCK AND NOT A COMPONENT. Its substance is the app's — where the headings come
 * from, which levels count, which column it sits in and at what width — and §11 has no row for
 * it. What is left for the system to own is an arrangement and a rank, which is what a copied
 * file carries safely: every colour and distance below resolves through the package. It is a
 * SOURCE block rather than a builder document for the reason the builder states about itself —
 * a document cannot express a handler, and this one watches the page as it scrolls.
 *
 * IT IS NOT A `NavTree`, and that was the first answer. The shape fits — a nav landmark, one
 * current item, two levels — but a nav tree makes a node with children a `<button aria-expanded>`
 * rather than a link, so every heading that has a sub-heading under it would stop being somewhere
 * you can go. A table of contents has no sections to open; it has places, all of them reachable.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS INSTEAD IS `Tabs`, TURNED VERTICAL. A list of section names where exactly one is
 * current, and §26's own sentence for how that one is marked: by INK and a RULE, never by a
 * louder fill. A fill here would be a row you PICK from a list — the row family's vocabulary,
 * which the sidebar beside this already speaks — and putting it in the gutter too would be two
 * sidebars on one page. `Accordion` made the same cut one component over ("is it a row tho?").
 *
 * SO THE PARTS ARE ALL BORROWED, EACH FROM THE COMPONENT THAT ARGUED IT:
 *
 *  - The links are `Breadcrumb`'s, not `Link`'s: the tone-less foreground roles in two ranks,
 *    and an underline that RESTS TRANSPARENT and paints under the pointer. Both are the same
 *    carve-out from WCAG 1.4.1 that §39 states — technique F73 is about a link inside a block of
 *    text, where hue is all that separates it from the words; a whole item in a list is not that
 *    case. `Link` itself is refused for §39's other reason too: it rests on `accent` and STAMPS
 *    it, and a stamped family re-scopes all three foreground roles onto that family's inks.
 *  - The mark on the current item is `Tabs`' indicator: the family's glyph role, and the label
 *    in the full ink — no heavier weight, because a semibold entry is wider than a medium one
 *    and the column would reflow on every scroll (§26's own measured argument).
 *  - The rail that mark is a segment of is `Separator`'s line and `Blockquote`'s (§7's edge
 *    order): `--color-border`, carrying no identity, so it reads as texture rather than as a
 *    second colour competing with the words.
 *  - The indent is `Tree`'s: one geometric step, so a sub-heading is told from its parent by
 *    where it starts and not by a third ink. Alignment by geometry, never by per-node judgement.
 *
 * NOTHING MOVES. The rail exists at rest in the quiet colour and CHANGES colour when its item
 * becomes current, which is Link's underline mechanism rotated ninety degrees: a border appearing
 * is a discrete change that arrives in one frame, and a border changing colour is a paint (§8).
 *
 * REFUSED, each for a reason the system already states:
 *
 *  - **The column, its width, and where it stops fitting.** A block may not decide those: they
 *    are measurements about this page's layout rather than about anything's box, and the docs'
 *    own `prose.css` states them on the class it passes in. It is also why nothing here is
 *    sticky — what this sits in is the caller's region, exactly as a footer's ground is the
 *    page's.
 *  - **Levels past three.** A table of contents that mirrors every heading has stopped being a
 *    summary; what to hand over is the caller's call, which is `Breadcrumb`'s `maxItems` refusal
 *    (§3) one component over.
 *  - **Smooth scrolling on click.** That is `scroll-behavior` on the document, a decision about
 *    the whole page, and a reader who asked their system for stillness must not be given it.
 *  - **`size` and `tone`.** A block is not a component with an API to grow — the steps are stated
 *    once, below, and another step is an edit to your copy.
