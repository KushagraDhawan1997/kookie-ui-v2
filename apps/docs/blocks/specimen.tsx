/**
 * The specimen BLOCK: a live component and its source, as ONE figure.
 *
 * ONE CONTAINER, NOT TWO SIBLINGS. The obvious alternative is a Card holding the specimen and
 * a code well beneath it, a step apart, with the gap meant to make them read as one figure. It
 * does not: two boxes a step apart are two boxes, and the reader has to be TOLD they belong
 * together. The argument against a single container — that "two wells stacked read as one
 * region rather than as a thing and its source" — is sound about two WELLS, and says nothing
 * about one pane holding both, which is what every peer ships and what this is.
 *
 * THE ARRANGEMENT IS THE SYSTEM'S OWN SENTENCE (§10): a Card is an object, a Surface is what
 * an object sits on. So the figure is a GROUND — it holds things, it is not one — carrying the
 * specimen on paper and its source beneath. The nesting is Apple's grouped-background pattern
 * and the one the builder's canvas already uses; the surface size join reads the OVERLAY band,
 * so the ground out-rounds the Card inside it by construction rather than by a number picked
 * here.
 *
 * IT IS A BLOCK AND NOT A DOCS COMPONENT, which took one change to be true. The pairing lived
 * in `app/(docs)/example.tsx` and could not be copied, because it read its source off disk
 * with `process.cwd()` — a docs-app assumption no copied file can carry. That read stays in
 * the docs app; this file takes `children` and a `code` string, which is the whole difference
 * between a block and a page component. `Example` is now a thin wrapper that does the reading.
 *
 * WHOSE PANE IS THE SPECIMEN'S: a component that IS a pane (Card, Surface, Composer) must not
 * be wrapped in another one — the docs shipped card-inside-card on four component pages for
 * weeks because nothing static could see it. The caller states it with `pane={false}` rather
 * than this file guessing, because the answer lives in the caller's own subject: the docs
 * derive it from the example's source, and a consumer knows what they are passing.

  /* A BACKDROP REACHES THE PANE'S EDGE.

     The stage is an ordinary child of the paper, so it takes the paper's reading inset like any
     content — which is right for the subject and wrong for the ground behind it. A photograph
     sitting inside a band of white pane is a picture ON the paper, and what `backdrop` says is
     that content passes BEHIND it: unbled, the figure draws the opposite of the thing the knob
     turns on. `m="bleed"` cancels the paper's own inset (§3, §10) and the pane clips it to its
     corner, so the photograph is the paper's whole face and the specimen floats on it.

     ONLY WHEN THERE IS A BACKDROP. Bleeding an unbacked stage would delete the paper's padding
     around the subject, which is the one thing the paper is there to provide.

     AND THE SUBJECT KEEPS ITS INSET. Bleeding alone takes the paper's padding off the stage,
     which is right for the BACKDROP and wrong for what stands on it: a small subject is centred
     and never notices, and anything that fills its line — a toolbar, a row, a frame — goes
     straight to the paper's wall. `p="bleed"` is the other half of the same keyword (§3): a
     margin's `bleed` cancels the surface's padding and a padding's re-applies it, so the
     photograph reaches the edge and the specimen sits exactly where it would have without one.

     WHICH SIDES DEPENDS ON WHAT HOLDS IT, and that is the same sentence rather than an exception.
     A stage on paper is the paper's only child, so it reaches all four walls. A stage with no
     paper — a Card or a Composer documenting itself — is one child of the GROUND, between the
     chrome row above it and the source below, so only its inline axis faces a wall: bleeding the
     block axis would run the photograph under the buttons and up against the code. Either way
     the backdrop reaches the edge it HAS, which is what stops one page's figure being a photo
     edge to edge and the next one's a band floating in a margin.

     BUT THE PADDING IS ALL FOUR SIDES IN BOTH ARMS. The no-paper arm re-padded only the axis it
     bled, so its block axis had no inset at all — a subject shorter than the floor was centred
     and never noticed, and a composer at size 3 or 4 grew past the floor and stood flush against
     the photograph's top and bottom edge. Which margins bleed depends on the walls; the inset the
     subject keeps does not. */
  const bleed = Boolean(stageBackground);
  /* AND THE FIGURE KEEPS ITS HEIGHT, which is the reason this is a plain value and not an
     expression. A floor that compensated for the bleed's missing padding was correct while the
     bled stage had none; once the stage re-pads itself, that compensation and the padding are
     one distance counted twice and the figure grows by exactly it — measured 290px of paper
     without the backdrop and 322 with, where an uncompensated bleed had SHRUNK it to 258. The
     stage's own padding is what the paper's used to be, so both arrangements compute one number
     by construction rather than through an expression kept in step with the margins. */

          distance is what separates the running thing from its source — which is the only seam

              `examples/grid.tsx` is the source of the RUNNING component as much as of the text
              under it, so naming it inside the code half labels one of the two halves with a fact
              about both — and sitting between them it reads as a divider rather than a title.

              THE COPY BUTTON SITS WITH IT. The argument for keeping it over the code is that
              that is what it copies, and the hosted well kills it: the button floats as GLASS so
              that lines can pass behind it while the well scrolls, and a hosted well has no pane
              of its own to float over — the material would be defending against a backdrop that
              is just the figure's ground. One chrome row at the top, naming the figure on one
              side and acting on it from the other, is what is left when that job disappears.

              So the code half is `bare`: no row, no floating chrome, nothing over the first line.
              The empty `<span/>` holds the end position when there is no name, which is the same
              fault `justify` answers inside the code sample — one child and `space-between`
              pushes it to the wrong wall. */}
          {/* IT REACHES THE WALL AND PUTS THE SMALLER NUMBER BACK. Left alone, this row sits
              25px from the ground's wall while the code sample's identical row sits 13px from
              its pane's — both obeying the same rule and disagreeing anyway.

              Chrome sits closer to the wall than reading matter does. The code sample's row is
              absolutely positioned, so it takes the chrome inset; this one is an ordinary child
              of the ground, so it would take the ground's READING inset like any content. The
              row is the same two buttons doing the same job in both, so it is chrome in both:
              `m="bleed"` undoes the ground's own inset and `p` puts the chrome number back,
              which is the standalone's spelling said in flow.

              `mx`, NOT `m`. Bleeding all four sides brings the BLOCK margins back too and pulls
              the specimen up under the buttons — measured, the card's top edge 4px ABOVE the
              button's bottom. Only the inline axis faces a wall here; the block axis faces the
              figure's own rhythm.

              THREE SIDES, NOT TWO. Bleeding the inline axis alone leaves the row's TOP at the
              ground's 24 while its sides sit at 12, so the same row that lines up with the code
              sample's horizontally sits twice as far down from its own pane's top edge.

              The code sample's row is `inset: 0` with one padding, so its top, left and right
              are one number by construction. `mt` + `mx` is that said in flow: three sides reach
              the wall, `p` puts the chrome number back on all four, and the fourth side — the
              one facing the specimen — keeps its margin, so the row's own bottom padding is the
              gap to what follows. Which is the code sample's arrangement exactly: the band under
              its row is the same inset, and the first line begins where it ends. */}
          {/* A TOOLBAR, NOT A HAND-WRITTEN ROW.

              It was `align="center" justify="space-between" gap="3"` — the alignment, the split
              and the air, said at a call site, which is the three facts a Toolbar states once.
              What it BUYS beyond that is the keyboard: the props trigger and the copy button
              were two separate tab stops with nothing grouping them, and a toolbar is one stop
              with arrow keys inside it.

              THE PLACEMENT IS A BOX AROUND IT, and the type is what says so: `Toolbar` refuses
              every spacing prop, because a component never sets its own outer spacing and the
              escape is a Box (§3). So the row states the alignment, the split and the air
              between clusters, and the Box states where the row sits. `mt`/`mx` reach three
              walls and `p` puts the chrome inset back on all four, so the fourth side's margin
              is the gap to what follows. The toolbar adds no padding of its own — its box is a
              minimum height, one control row at this index.

              AND THE INSET IS THE PANE'S OWN, `bleed` BOTH WAYS — a margin's bleed cancels the
              surface padding, a padding's re-applies it (§3), so the chrome rests at exactly
              the distance the pane states. It was a picked `4`, which is 12px against the code
              well's 24: the same disagreement the well had between its own two rows, one level
