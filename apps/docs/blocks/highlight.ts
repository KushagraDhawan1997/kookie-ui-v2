/**
 * Syntax highlighting, in the system's own colours (2026-08-21; LOG), with the author's
 * annotations since 2026-08-26.
 *
 * Shiki is the Base UI relationship one layer over: TextMate grammars are decades of
 * accumulated correctness nobody should rewrite, they are behaviour rather than appearance,
 * and they are invisible until someone paints them. So the grammars are theirs and every
 * colour is ours.
 *
 * The mechanism is Shiki's CSS-variables theme: instead of baking hexes, the tokenizer emits
 * `var(--code-token-*)` and the package's `CodeBlock` resolves those names against the ten
 * tones' SOLVED ink ladder (§15, 2026-08-10). That is the load-bearing part. A stock highlight theme is a
 * second colour system living inside the first — the one place on a site made of KookieUI
 * where the pixels would not be KookieUI's — and it would also be the only text on the page
 * held to no contrast target at all.
 *
 * THE PIPELINE IS `codeToHast`, NOT `codeToTokens` (2026-08-26), and the reason is a fact
 * about Shiki: notation transformers only annotate the HAST — they never run in the token
 * pipeline. So the author's annotations (`// [!code highlight]`, `[!code ++]`, `[!code
 * focus]`, fence meta `{1,3}` and `/word/`) require walking the tree Shiki built. The walk
 * reduces it straight back to lines of tokens: nothing is trusted as markup, nothing is
 * `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, and the renderer stays a map over plain data. The walk is LOUD
 * (the tokens.test.ts parser rule): a shape this file does not recognise throws rather than
 * degrading, because a silent one-char slice is how a negative assertion goes green.
 *
 * BOLD IS DROPPED, ITALIC IS KEPT, and the asymmetry is the type system's (§15, 2026-08-09:
 * `bold` is refused package-wide, and a value left reachable is one every call site can
 * re-introduce). Italic is not a weight and stays — it is the one signal separating a comment
 * from the code around it that does not spend a colour.
