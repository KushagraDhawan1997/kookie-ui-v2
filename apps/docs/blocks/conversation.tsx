/**
 * A conversation with an agent: the transcript that holds it, and the parts of it that are not
 * words — the person's own message, the run of steps an agent takes between replies, and the
 * pictures a turn made. A question the agent stops to ask is not here: it waits at the composer,
 * as a `Confirmation` in its `notices`, and only the answer is recorded in the transcript.
 *
 * WHY A BLOCK. Every part here is an arrangement of package components with the words and the
 * pictures supplied by the app, and one piece of state (whether a run is open). That is the
 * definition of a source block. Following the live edge is the package's `MessageScroller`, and
 * `Conversation` is only where it is put together with the pane's own scroller.
 *
 * WHAT THE BEST CHATS AGREED ON, and so what this draws:
 *
 *  - **The person's words sit right, on a tint, with no edge**, and the reply has no bubble at
 *    all and takes the full measure (ChatGPT, Claude). Attachments sit above the bubble they
 *    came with, as thumbnails.
 *  - **A run of tool calls folds to one row.** Live, the row says what is happening now; done, it
 *    says how much happened, and opens to the list (ChatGPT's "Thought for", Perplexity's
 *    "Completed N steps", Cursor's grouped tool calls, Flora's "View steps"). A step that failed
 *    and was put right stays inside with the others; only a failure that stops the turn belongs
 *    in the conversation.
 *  - **Pictures are the result, so they stay out of the fold**: one at its own shape, several in a
 *    grid of squares (Midjourney's four, ChatGPT's sets). No captions; what they are called is the
 *    app's to show where the pictures live.
 *
 * REFUSED:
 *
 *  - **English.** The summary ("6 steps"), each step's words and every label are the caller's,
 *    because a copied file cannot localise and the counts are the app's grammar.
 *  - **A reply bubble.** `Reply` is text that keeps its line breaks and nothing more; a reply is
 *    read at the full measure with no box around it.
 *  - **Timing.** "Worked for 42 seconds" needs the app's clock, so it is a summary the app writes.
 *  - **A lightbox.** What opening a picture does (a dialog, the canvas, a download) is the app's.
 *
 * SIZE 3 IS THE DEFAULT, against the package's 2: a conversation is the
 * thing being read, and it was one step under the composer and the toolbar around it. The index
 * rides the part's own text and the lengths derived from it — the thumbnail's height, the
 * timeline's half-row, the corners — through `data-kb-size` in the stylesheet.
