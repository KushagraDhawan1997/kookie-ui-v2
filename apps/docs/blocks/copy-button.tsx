/**
 * Copy-to-clipboard for a code sample. The one interactive part of a code block, and the
 * only reason any of this is a client component — everything else about a fence is decided
 * at build time.
 *
 * The confirmation is the BUTTON ITSELF saying so, not a toast: a toast is a floating layer
 * announcing something the thing you just pressed can say itself, and this system has no toast
 * anyway (§11 lists one; it has never shipped). It reverts on a timer, which is state, not
 * motion — nothing here reads a motion token.
 *
 * WHAT SAYS IT depends on what the button has (2026-08-30). A labelled button changes its
 * label; an icon-only one changes its GLYPH to a check, and its accessible name with it, so a
 * screen reader hears the confirmation a sighted reader sees. The check was always there — it
 * is the label that turns out to be the optional half.

   * Kushagra): its label is the object, so a copy mark there would say the same thing twice
   * and two identical marks at either end of one pane would read as two of the same control.
   *
   * The CONFIRMATION is not overridable. Whatever the resting glyph, a press shows the check
   * — that is the button reporting what happened, and a component that let a call site
   * silence it would let a call site ship a copy that never says it copied.

   * every editor, terminal and code host on the web has trained this glyph.
   *
   * The name does not go away, it stops being PAINTED: `aria-label` carries it, and Button's
   * own type refuses an icon-only control without one, so this cannot silently ship a button

  /* THE GLYPH IS THE RESTING ONE, ALWAYS (2026-09-02). This used to be

     frame — React unmounts the outgoing glyph, and an unmounted element cannot leave.

     `done` is Button's own state now, and it draws the confirmation: it mounts the system's
     tick beside this glyph, stacked in one cell, and CSS crosses them. The tick is the same
     drawing a checkbox's mark is. What stays here is the STATE and its timer, which is the
     rule §29 states one component over — a control that ran its own clock would decide, for
     every app, how long "just now" lasts.

     One glyph expression for both arms: an icon-only button puts it in `children` (there the
     glyph IS the content), a labelled one puts it in `leading` (there it adorns a label).
     Button's own comment states that split; this is the only place it has to be honoured. */
