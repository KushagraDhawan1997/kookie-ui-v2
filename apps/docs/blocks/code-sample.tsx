/**
 * The code-sample BLOCK: a labelled, copyable, annotatable code figure. The first entry in
 * the blocks registry (`blocks/index.tsx`), and the one the docs themselves consume — every
 * MDX fence and every example's source renders through this file, so the block ships with a
 * real consumer rather than a demo.
 *
 * WHAT A BLOCK IS HERE (THESIS §6): copied source, not published code — and copy-paste is
 * only safe when the copied file makes no design decisions of its own. shadcn's copy-paste is centerless *by construction* because the decisions travel
 * in the copy; here every colour, distance and step resolves through the package, so the
 * center stays in the dependency and the copy carries only arrangement and behaviour.
 * Behaviour is allowed (the copy button's state, the expand control); invented values are not.
 *
 * THE FIVE JOBS: show (the element), name (the header's label or title), take (the copy
 * button), point (the author's annotations — line and word highlight, focus, diff, error
 * marks), and bound (`maxLines`, scroll-not-clip, expand as convenience).
 * Everything else the ecosystem ships is another component wearing this one's name (code
 * groups are Tabs; preview is the Example frame) or decoration (window chrome, icons).
 *
 * THE CHROME'S SHAPE: the NAME sits outside, a sibling row aligned to the code with the
 * pane's own inset token (`--surface-p-N`); the ACTIONS float over the pane — copy top-right,
 * expand bottom-centre — as
 * GLASS (`backdrop`, the theme's material: the docs Theme runs `material="regular"`), at
 * Button's own medium default, because a floating control over content is exactly what the
 * material defends. No gradient — a scrollable well with a scrollbar already says "more".
 * SIZE PRICES EVERYTHING — pane, code step, label, copy and expand buttons all ride one
 * index — the ownership rule (§25, §30).
 *
 * WHAT THE COPY BUTTON HANDS OVER IS THE STRIPPED SOURCE — `plainText(lines)`, the code with
 * every `[!code …]` annotation removed, derived from the same tokens the paint renders, so
 * the clipboard and the pixels cannot disagree. Diff markers are real spans (a pseudo cannot
 * coexist with the line-number counter) but `aria-hidden` and `user-select: none`, so neither
 * assistive technology nor a drag-selection ever meets them.
 *
 * Async, and therefore server-only: tokenizing is build-time work, so a code fence costs the
 * reader nothing but the markup it produces. The client components are the copy button and,
 * only when the bound binds, the expand control.

     language name is a caption: there is nothing to copy and nothing to press, so it stays an
     inert `Chip`. They look different because they DO different things, which is this
     system's own rule rather than an inconsistency to tidy away.

     The chip keeps `backdrop` and the button takes it by construction, so both resolve the

     fence. `Terminal` is the one that survives: it tells a reader the lines go
     in a shell rather than in their editor, which is the only thing here a reader could get
     wrong. CSS, JSON and HTML are unlabelled for the same reason as TSX — a stylesheet looks
     like a stylesheet, and knowing which file it belongs in is a question the prose around it
     answers, not a chip.

     Keyed on `bash` rather than on a list, so adding a language does not silently add a label:
     a new one has to argue its way in here. */

  /* ONE ROW, FLOATING OVER THE CODE.

     Moving it into FLOW is the wrong repair for the overlap it causes: a translucent control
     exists to be legible with content passing behind it, so a glass row with nothing behind it
     is decoration wearing a material's name. What is actually wrong is that the first line has
     nowhere to rest, and the answer to that is an inset, not flow — the platform pattern, where
     a scroll view holds a top contentInset and its content passes under a translucent toolbar.
     The band is a safe area, not an apology.

     IT SPANS THE PANE AND PADS ITSELF. The pane's inset is a READING measure — the distance
     a line of code needs from a wall — and chrome is not reading matter, so `inset-inline`
     reaches both walls and `p` puts a smaller number back.
     The buttons sit closer to the edge than the code does, which is what says they belong to
     the pane rather than to the text.

     A HOSTED SAMPLE IS THE OTHER CASE and does not disagree with it. Its own box IS the code
     column, so `inset-inline: 0` starts at the host's inset and any padding adds to it; the
     chrome REACHES the host's wall, which is the line below. Aligning both arrangements to the
     code is the wrong repair — one of them is already right.

     `z-index` is deliberately absent, and the row is rendered AFTER the scroller instead.
     Paint order alone does not settle it — `.kui-scroll-area` is positioned too, so the two
     settle on DOM order — and order is the whole fix: a z-index would be the number ladder
     §20 exists to avoid. */
  /* AND THE BAND IS ALWAYS RESERVED, name or no name.

     It was conditional: with a name at one wall and the copy button at the other the row covers
     the whole of line 1, so line 1 needed somewhere else to be — and with only the button, the
     argument ran, reserving a pane's width of clearance for a control in one corner puts a
     hand's width of nothing in the top-left.

     That argument is about the pixels the chrome COVERS, and a safe area is not about coverage.
     It is the band the pane says its chrome lives in, and a reader scanning a page of fences
     should not have to work out per fence whether the code begins under the buttons or beside
     them. The conditional bought a little of the top-left back and paid for it with two
     different code blocks on one page, which is the more expensive thing by a distance.

     So one rule: a fence that draws chrome reserves the band for it. `bare` still reserves
     nothing, because a bare fence draws no chrome at all — that is not the same fact wearing a
     condition, it is the absence of the row.

     `space-between` with ONE child pushes it to the START, so the empty wall has to be stated:
     the row means "name at one wall, action at the other", and with no name there is only the
     action, which takes the end.

A TOOLBAR, NOT A `Flex`. The row was stating the alignment, the split and the air itself —
     the three facts a Toolbar says once — and it earns the keyboard too whenever there is a
     name, because a path here is a `CopyButton` and not a label, so this row is usually TWO
     controls that were two separate tab stops.

     The justification conditional went with it, and that is the trade rather than a win: a
     toolbar is always `space-between`, so the empty wall is an empty child instead of a
     different value. It is honest in the same way the old spelling was — both say "there is
     nothing on that side" — and the toolbar cannot guess which side that is, because which
     controls sit where is what those controls mean. */

     that — mono, sized off the line it sits in, no box of its own to disagree with the row's.

     WHAT IT IS NOT, and each was tried: a `Chip`, which is an atom priced for a sentence and
     lands at neither a chrome row's height nor its step; a `CopyButton`, which makes a name
     pressable; a TAB, which announces a list of places when there is one; and anything in the
     TOOLBAR, which is where controls live — the name is not one, and putting it there was what
     made it float over the first line it was naming.

     IT SITS IN THE PANE WITH THE CODE, which is what the figure already does one file over
     (`file-tabs.tsx`): the label names the code, so it belongs in the box the code is in. So a
     named sample takes the figure's arrangement — a Surface holding the label and a HOSTED
     well — rather than a caption stacked above a pane that draws itself. One pane either way.
