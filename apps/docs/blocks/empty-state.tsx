/**
 * The empty state: what a region shows when it has nothing to show (2026-09-02).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A BLOCK AND NOT A COMPONENT. Its substance is entirely the app's — which words,
 * which mark, which action — and §11 has no row for it. What is left for the system to own is an
 * arrangement and a rank, which is exactly what a copied file carries safely: every colour,
 * distance and step below resolves through the package.
 *
 * AND WHY IT IS A SOURCE BLOCK RATHER THAN A BUILDER DOCUMENT, which is the objection that
 * nearly killed it: if the three states below produce the same markup, this is pure assembly, and
 * assembly is a document. The answer is the rule the builder already states about itself — a
 * document cannot express a handler. An empty state's action is a real button with an `onClick`,
 * its mark is a node, its words are the caller's; none of that is expressible as a frozen tree.
 * The same cut kept `Specimen` out of the builder and put `Tree`'s keyboard in the package.
 *
 * WHAT APPLE DOES, checked rather than remembered (2026-09-02). The HIG has no empty-state
 * COMPONENT — the same finding as the message family, where their answer is guidance in the
 * Onboarding and Writing register rather than a component page. But SwiftUI ships
 * `ContentUnavailableView` (iOS 17), and its slots are the four below, in this order: a label
 * carrying a title and a symbol, a description, and actions last. The shape here was specified
 * before that was read and did not have to move, which is the strongest evidence available that
 * it is the shape.
 *
 * THREE STATES, AND `reason` IS NOT A PROP. This is the part every system gets wrong, and it is
 * editorial rather than structural:
 *
 *   1. **Nothing yet.** Nothing has been created. The action CREATES the first one.
 *   2. **Nothing matched.** A search or a filter emptied the list. The action CLEARS the filter,
 *      quietly — offering "Create your first project" under a search that returned nothing is the
 *      specific mistake this block exists to prevent, and it is what most libraries ship.
 *   3. **Nothing available.** It failed, or you may not see it. The action RETRIES.
 *
 * They differ in words and in rank, not in arrangement, so a `reason` prop would switch nothing.
 * The taxonomy lives in the demos and in the prose, where an editorial rule can be taught. Apple
 * agrees on the split and reaches the same conclusion by a different road: their one concession
 * is `ContentUnavailableView.search(text:)`, a separate constructor whose words are already
 * written — which we cannot copy, because it bakes English. `Notice`'s `dismissLabel` set that
 * precedent: Apple ships localisations and a copied file does not.
 *
 * IT IS NOT A `Notice`, and the boundary is the one §29 draws by asking what made the message
 * appear. A notice is a message BESIDE content that still exists, and its placement is the
 * caller's. This IS the region's content — there is nothing behind it — so a notice here would be
 * a message in a box of chrome around nothing.
 *
 * REFUSED, each for a reason the system already states:
 *
 *  - **More than one primary action.** `action` and `secondary` are two named slots rather than
 *    an `actions` array, and the type IS the rule: an array is an invitation, and three buttons
 *    in an empty state is the failure. §11's one-focal-point rule, held by anatomy the way
 *    `AlertDialog` holds it.
 *  - **An illustration set, or `variant="search" | "error"`.** §8 ships no icon set, and a named
 *    set of states is a product vocabulary the system must not own (`Badge`'s own refusal).
 *  - **`size`, `tone`, `emphasis`.** A block is not a component with an API to grow — the steps
 *    are stated once, below, and other steps are an edit to your copy.
 *  - **A pane, and a `minHeight`.** What this sits in is the caller's region, exactly as a
 *    footer's ground is the page's. It centres when the region has height and hugs when it does
 *    not, so there is no number to pass.
 *  - **`aria-live`.** Whether this should be ANNOUNCED depends on whether it arrived, and only
 *    the caller knows that — was the list always empty, or did your filter just empty it? The
 *    live region belongs on the results region wrapping both the list and this. Saying it here
 *    would announce a first-use state on every page load.

  /* THE RHYTHM IS §15's, AND IT IS ASYMMETRIC ON PURPOSE (rule 5): generous above a heading,
     tight below it, because the space above separates it from what came before and the space
     below binds it to what it introduces. `2` inside the words and `5` around them is the 4x
     that rule asks for, and the difference is what stops the three regions reading as one stack.

     THE STEPS ARE A PAIR, AND THEY MOVE TOGETHER (2026-09-02, Kushagra: the title "should be a
     bit smaller"). It shipped at the house ladder's own rungs — block title `6` over body `3`,
     24 over 16, a ratio of 1.50 — and `5` alone would have been 20 over 16, which is **1.25** and
     under the 1.33 §15 rule 1 asks of adjacent levels. That rule is the one that calls a small
     ratio "not a hierarchy, a rounding error", so taking the title down obliges taking the
     sentence down with it: `5` over `2` is 20 over 14, **1.43**, and the hierarchy survives the
     smaller title.

     `5` and `2` are both steps §15 marks as decisions rather than defaults, which is what this
     paragraph is: the title is a decision because a region's own label should not shout at a page
     that has already been titled, and the sentence is `2` because it is supporting text under a
     label rather than reading matter. */
