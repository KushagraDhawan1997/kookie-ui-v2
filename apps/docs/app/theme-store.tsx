/**
 * The site's Theme axes as a store, and the root Theme that reads them (2026-09-08, Kushagra:
 * "give me a prop configurator for Theme somewhere… next to dark mode toggle").
 *
 * Appearance and contrast stay in `appearance.tsx`: they live on `<html>` for the pre-paint
 * script, and nothing here touches them. Every other axis is a prop on the root `<Theme>`, so
 * the panel writes here and `DocsTheme` re-renders the root with the choice. Same shape as the
 * appearance store: the session's truth is memory, storage is persistence, and a write that
 * cannot persist must never stop the change from being applied.
 *
 * The server snapshot is the site's own resting choice (`material="regular"`, `size="2"`, the
 * package defaults for the rest), so the first paint is what layout.tsx always rendered and a
 * stored choice arrives after hydration — the window-class hook's own honesty.
