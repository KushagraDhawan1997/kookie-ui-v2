/**
 * THE MARKDOWN TWIN'S ROUTE (2026-09-06, §47).
 *
 * `/components/button.md` reaches here. The `.md` suffix is a REWRITE in `next.config.ts`,
 * because a file extension is not something the router can express: a segment either is a
 * dynamic parameter or is not, and `[...slug].md` is neither. So the URL a reader sees carries
 * the extension the convention asks for, and the route underneath it is an ordinary catch-all.
 *
 * The handler is one lookup and one response. Everything it knows about what a page contains
 * is in `markdown.ts` — this file must never grow a branch about a KIND of page, or the site
 * gains a second place that knows what a component page is made of.
