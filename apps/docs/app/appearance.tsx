 * policy, a sandboxed frame. The readers below are the `getSnapshot` argument to
 * `useSyncExternalStore`, so they run during RENDER, on every route the header mounts on —
 * which is all of them. Unguarded, that throw escaped to Next's global error boundary and
 * replaced the whole document with "This page couldn't load", unrecoverable by reload.
 *
 * The asymmetry that let it ship: the pre-paint script (appearance-script.ts) has always
 * wrapped these same two reads in try/catch, so the half of the mechanism that fails SAFELY
 * was guarded and the half that kills the page was not. One mechanism, one rule.
 *
 * Degrading to "system"/"auto" is the right failure: matchMedia needs no storage, so a
 * visitor who cannot persist a choice still gets a correct appearance — they just cannot
 * override the OS.
