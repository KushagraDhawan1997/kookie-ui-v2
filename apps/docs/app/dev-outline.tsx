/**
 * The outline: every box on the page, on a bare `o`. Dev only.
 *
 * Ported from kushagradhawan-v2's DevOverlay, which holds two tools (a column grid and this).
 * Only the outline came across — the docs have no site grid to draw.
 *
 * It renders no markup of its own, because it has nothing to draw: it borrows every box
 * already on the page. The state is a `data-outline` attribute on <html>, which is also the
 * only element the rule below can be written against.
 *
 * `outline`, not `border` or `box-shadow`. An outline is painted outside the box and takes no
 * layout space, so it cannot move the boxes it is measuring — which is the whole job. A
 * border would push every nested element by 2px per level.
 *
 * BOTH THE RULE AND THE SCRIPT ARE GATED ON DEV, in one place: this component returns null in
 * a production build, so neither the CSS nor the listener ships. The rule lives here rather
 * than in globals.css for exactly that reason — globals.css has no way to be dev-only, and a
 * rule that styles `*` is not a thing to leave in a shipped stylesheet on the argument that
 * nothing writes the attribute.
 *
 * A second tool is a row in TOOLS, not a second component.
