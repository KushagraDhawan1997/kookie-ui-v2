/**
 * The docs' glyphs — Hugeicons, one named wrapper per glyph (2026-08-10, Kushagra: "The docs
 * app should only use hugeicons").
 *
 * This is not a hole in "no third-party UI". That stance is about COMPONENTS: a design system
 * whose docs run on someone else's buttons argues against itself. §8 says the opposite about
 * icons in as many words — the package ships no icon dependency, icons are `ReactNode` slots,
 * and *the app installs its own set*. The hand-drawn strokes that were here were the app
 * declining to install one, which was fine while three glyphs were enough and stopped being
 * fine the day the playground started showing real screens: a toolbar, a member row and a
 * composer are made of glyphs, and drawing them badly makes the composition the thing under
 * judgement instead of the system.
 *
 * `@hugeicons/react` + `@hugeicons/core-free-icons`, both MIT.
 *
 * Wrappers rather than re-exports, for two reasons. The call sites say what the glyph MEANS
 * (`SearchIcon`) rather than which drawing was picked (`Search01Icon`), so swapping a drawing
 * is one edit here. And the props that must be right every time — `aria-hidden`, and NOT
 * passing `size` — are set once. Size is deliberately absent: the control layer sizes a slot's
 * svg through `--kui-ct-icon` (recipes.css), and `size` would emit width/height attributes
 * that the CSS then has to beat. It does beat them, presentation attributes losing to any
 * declaration, but relying on that is a mechanism nobody wrote down.

 * the package's own chevrons carry — and they did not match, because those are drawn on a 16
 * viewBox and Hugeicons on a 24, so one number painted 1.5px there and 1.0px here. `iconStroke`
 * is the number for the 24 grid, and the package converts it for its own. It is not absolute:
 * `absoluteStrokeWidth` would rescale the stroke against the `size` prop, and this file never
 * passes one — the box comes from CSS, so there is nothing for it to scale against and the
 * flag would silently do nothing.
