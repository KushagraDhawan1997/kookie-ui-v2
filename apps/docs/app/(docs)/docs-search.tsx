/**
 * Search (2026-08-21) — the package's `Command` since 2026-09-04.
 *
 * It was the SECOND palette assembled by hand in this repo: a `Dialog` holding a `TextField`
 * and a list of `Row`s, with its own `active` index and its own arrow/Enter branches. The
 * builder's ⌘K went first, and this one is the same deletion — DECISIONS §44's whole claim is
 * that the keyboard model belongs to the package and no app should write it twice, and writing
 * it twice is exactly what this repo was doing.
 *
 * THREE THINGS ARE THIS APP'S AND STAYED. **The ranking**, which is why `filter` is `null` here
 * rather than a matcher passed through: `searchEntries` scores an exact title over a prefix over
 * a substring over the haystack, and caps at twelve. A boolean predicate can do neither, so the
 * app narrows its own array and hands it in — the path §44 described and could not offer until
 * `onQueryChange` existed. §44's refusal of fuzzy reordering is untouched and is about something
 * else: a palette of COMMANDS keeps the table's order because muscle memory is most of what it
 * is for, and prose has no order of its own to keep. **The rows are links**, which is what
 * `render` on `CommandItem` was opened for the same day — a result is a place, and a row that
 * navigates without being an anchor has no middle-click, no open-in-new-tab, no URL on the
 * status bar and nothing announced as a link. **And ⌘K is bound here**, because which chord
 * opens a palette is the app's decision (§44 refuses to own it) and Chrome's own ⌘K takes the
 * address bar unless the default is prevented.
 *
 * WHAT WENT, and neither is a loss. The title and the description paragraph: §44 refuses a title
 * because the field is the affordance, and the description was definitional — it explained what
 * the index covers to someone who had not yet typed. What it had to say is said where it is
 * decision-relevant, in the empty state, at the moment a search has come back with nothing.
