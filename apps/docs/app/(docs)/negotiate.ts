/**
 * CONTENT NEGOTIATION for the markdown twin (2026-09-07).
 *
 * Every page on this site is already served twice — once as HTML and once as markdown at the
 * same path with `.md` on the end. What was missing is the half the web has had a mechanism
 * for since 1996: a client that says it wants markdown should get markdown from the CANONICAL
 * url, without knowing our spelling of the alternate. An agent handed a link in a message has
 * no reason to guess that `.md` is the suffix we chose, and `Accept` is how it asks.
 *
 * NOTHING ABOUT THE CONTENT CHANGES. The negotiated response is the twin's own route, reached
 * by a rewrite — one body, one `markdownFor()`, no second renderer. This file decides only
 * WHETHER, never WHAT.
 *
 * BY POSITION AND BY q, NEVER BY PRESENCE. Every browser's navigation header ends in a
 * wildcard range at q=0.8, so "does the header mention markdown" would serve a markdown
 * document to everyone. A real Chromium navigation ranks `text/html` first at q=1 and reaches
 * markdown only through that wildcard, and the ordering is what tells the two apart. A plain
 * `fetch()` sends the wildcard alone, which prefers NEITHER, and a tie goes to HTML: markdown
 * is served when it is asked for, not when nothing was.

 * request's own `Host` instead — and a header is not a place to start. A client resolves it
 * against the request URL, which is the same answer with nothing made up.

 * false — each of them a tie, and a tie is not a request.

 * first — so a client that named html exactly and markdown only by accident would be handed
 * markdown. Naming a type is a stronger statement than covering it, so markdown wins a tie
