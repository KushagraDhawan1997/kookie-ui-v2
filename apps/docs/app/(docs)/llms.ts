 * `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` (llmstxt.org, Answer.AI 2024).
 *
 * The half of this work that needs nobody to press anything: an index of the site at a
 * conventional path, so an agent handed only the domain can find every page without guessing a
 * URL or crawling markup. `llms.txt` is the contents; `llms-full.txt` is the whole site in one
 * fetch, which is what an agent asked to "use KookieUI" actually wants.
 *
 * THE ORIGIN IS AN ARGUMENT, not a constant and not a lookup. This repo has no site URL
 * anywhere — no `metadataBase`, no environment variable — and inventing one here would be a
 * fact with a single home that is wrong on every deploy but one, including the localhost the
 * author reads it on. The request already carries the answer, so the ROUTE reads the header
 * and these two functions take a string: everything that touches the framework is at the
 * edge, and everything a law needs to check is a pure function of one input.
