 * It draws no chrome, and the absence is the whole point: every layout above this boundary is
 * kept, so `layout.tsx` has already rendered `DocsChrome` around whatever lands here. The root
 * `app/not-found.tsx` is the other case — nothing matched, no group layout ran — and it wraps
 * the same body in the chrome itself.
