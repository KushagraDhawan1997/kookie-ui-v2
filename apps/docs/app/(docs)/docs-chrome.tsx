/**
 * The docs site, in KookieUI's own Shell (§27).
 *
 * This is the second real consumer the Shell has — the builder was the first, and porting it
 * found a hide mechanism that had been dead since the day it shipped. A docs site is the
 * honest second: a navigation column, a scrolling body, and a phone posture, which is the
 * plainest thing an app frame is ever asked for. Everything the reader sees here is a
 * package export.
 *
 * NO HEADER (2026-08-26, Kushagra). The header's whole content was a wordmark, search and
 * two utilities — none of it about the page you are reading — so the row it occupied was
 * 100% chrome. The sidebar absorbs all of it through the Shell's own pinned-stack anatomy
 * (§27: siblings before a ShellScroll pin above it, siblings after pin below): the wordmark
 * and search are the sidebar's unofficial header, the GitHub link and the appearance Select
 * its unofficial footer. What the header used to guarantee — a route back to the sidebar
 * once it is closed or an overlay — moves to a trigger FLOATING in the content pane.
 *
 * The sidebar rests `auto` — open on a roomy window, an overlay on a narrow one, resolved in
 * CSS through §18's window class, so first paint is right with no script and hydration cannot
 * mismatch.
 *
 * A COMPONENT RATHER THAN THE LAYOUT ITSELF, because it has two callers Next will never let
 * share one: `layout.tsx` wraps the route group, and `not-found.tsx` cannot be in that group —
 * Next matches an unknown URL against no segment at all and wraps the root not-found in the
 * ROOT layout only. That is not hypothetical here: when the chrome last moved into a route
 * group (2026-08-08) the 404 was left behind and rendered with no header, no inset and no
 * `<main>` landmark, its heading flush in the viewport's corner with the ascenders clipped.
 * A route group is a layout boundary, not a place.

          builds `--kui-shell-inset-inline-start` — the reach this pane's floating chrome clears
          — from the TOKEN, and a `width` prop is an inline style on the pane that no sibling
          can read. Measured, the guard was firing in dev: 288px published against a 336px pane,
          so the search and back buttons sat 48px inside the sidebar they are meant to clear.
          Stating the token here is §27's own escape, where "the pane and the content read one
          number", and the drag now moves this same name (see the resize note in shell.tsx), so

            what it indexes.

            No `onResize` and no persistence. The Shell sits in this route group's layout, so a
            dragged width survives every navigation and resets on reload — which is the honest
            behaviour until the site has somewhere to put the number. Persisting it is not a

             NOT A WRAPPING FIX, and the first spelling of this comment said it was: measured,
             the tightest row at 288 ("The component families", at the tree's second level) had
             46px of slack, so nothing was near the wall and no title has ever wrapped. What the

             air after the words is what lets the indent read as nesting. It is a judgment, and
             the resize bounds are unchanged, so a reader who disagrees drags it.

              THE LOGO IS THE WORD (Kushagra, 2026-09-01). It has been three things: the word
              in a condensed grotesque, then a single drawn capital in a blackletter, and now
              the word again in a script. The middle one was right for the face it was set in —
              a blackletter's capitals are its ornate half, so "KookieUI" set there had two
              adjacent capitals at the end reading as one shape, and a lone initial is what that
              kind of face has always been best at. A script is a face for WRITING a name, so it
              took the word back. `wordmark.tsx` carries the reasoning; what changed here is
              only that the link now wraps a word rather than a letter.

              THE ACCESSIBLE NAME IS STILL THE LINK'S. The mark is decoration doing a logo's
              job and is `aria-hidden` either way, so the link states `aria-label` and a screen
              reader announces "KookieUI" — which is what keeps the one route back to the home
              page from announcing itself as a picture with no name.

              THE GLYPH ITSELF IS `<Wordmark>` (2026-08-29), because the front door now sets
              the same mark above its title and the three facts that make it the mark — the
              face, the regular weight, the collapsed line box — cannot be copied to a second
              call site and stay one thing. Why each of them is what it is lives beside the
              component. What stays HERE is the only fact that is about this placement rather
              than the mark: the link. */}
          {/* One row, not two (2026-08-28) — search moved in beside the mark once it became
              an icon button rather than a full-width fake input, the same `Flex
              justify="space-between"` shape the footer row below already uses.

              THE ROW CENTRES ITSELF AGAIN (2026-09-01, Kushagra: the mark is "not center
              aligned with say, search"). Both children carried `alignSelf: "start"` from
              2026-08-29, and the reason was real THEN: the mark was a lone display capital
              whose line box towers over a 32px icon button, so centring the row sank the
              button against the GLYPH's height, below the collapse trigger floating in the
              content pane next door. Now the mark is a word rather than a display capital, so
              centring is what the eye wants and the overrides are gone rather than re-tuned:
              the part's own `align-items: center` places both children and nothing here
              restates it.

              THAT LEFT FOUR PIXELS, closed 2026-09-02: centring is only level with the pane
              next door while both rows are the same height, and the mark's own collapsed box
              was 40px against the row's 32, so the sidebar's band grew and took both of its
              children down with it. The mark's box is the row now — see `kd-masthead` below. */}

                this pane's chrome, so the row states their rhythm and their index, and the
                band publishes its own row back to the pane so the frame's safe area follows
                the toolbar's own index (§27).

                NO `size="3"` HERE ANY MORE (same day). It was stated on both bands for a few
                hours, which is what said the default was wrong: a band rests one step above
                the app's own index now, so this row is 3 in an app resting at 2 and follows
                the app if it ever moves. A value repeated at every call site is not a default,
                it is a tax — the argument `Theme size` itself shipped on.

                `backdrop` ON THE ROW since the same day: the band floats, so content passes
                behind everything in it, and that is one fact about the space rather than a prop

                `marginInlineStart` to clear the floating sidebar, which `shell.css` now spends
                on the band itself: the frame publishes that reach, so nothing here restates it.

                What the row BUYS is the keyboard: one tab stop for the whole band, arrow keys
                between the controls, `role="toolbar"` announced. Every control in it is a
                `ToolbarButton` for that reason — a plain Button cannot enrol itself in the
                composite, and an unregistered control in a toolbar is a tab stop the arrows
                never reach.

                Its index is the band step and its `backdrop` covers the row — neither is a
                number or a prop written per control here. See the sidebar's row above. */}

                    `Page` in this pane, silent while that page's large title is on screen and
                    arriving when it has scrolled up behind this band. At the leading edge, where
                    macOS puts a document's name — the row states the air around it, so nothing
                    here spaces it away from the buttons before it (§45). */}

                  is `space-between`, so a second child needs no alignment stated and no
                  spacer: the row already says where two clusters sit.

                  The list is computed HERE because this is a server component and the twin's
                  module reads files off disk. The control decides nothing about which pages
                  have one — it is handed the answer, so there is no second implementation of
                  a question `markdown.ts` already answers. */}

                  door this is the repository alone — which is what stops that page's band from
                  being a toggle at one wall and nothing at the other.

                  The gap is the one `PageActions` states between its own two tracks, for the
                  same reason: the air between two groups has to be wider than the air inside
                  one, or the grouping says nothing. */}
              {/* AND IT COLLAPSES WHEN THE ROW RUNS OUT (§45, 2026-09-08). It was a `Flex`,
                  which is the right container for a cluster and the wrong one for a cluster
                  that has to fit: on a phone this band held eight controls and simply ran off
                  the screen, with the last of them sliced in half and no route to any of it.
                  `ToolbarOverflow` measures instead of guessing, which is what this row needs
                  and a breakpoint could not give it — the walk draws nothing outside the reading
                  order and the page actions draw nothing on a route with no twin, so how full
                  this band is depends on the page, not on the window.

                  The gap it states is the row's own, which is what the `Flex` here resolved to
                  anyway. Collapsing runs from the END, so the repository goes first, then what
                  you can do with the page, and the walk is the last thing to leave the row. */}
