 * A chapter's table of contents, read from its SOURCE rather than from the rendered tree.

 * would mean rendering a chapter twice, once to find out what is in it. Reading the file
 * costs one `readFileSync` at build time and the result is static.
 *
 * The anchors come from `slugify` — the same function the heading mapping calls — so the
 * links and their targets cannot disagree. That is the mechanism-with-two-implementations
 * rule (ENGINEERING) applied before it could bite: two spellings of one identity is exactly
 * how a table of contents comes to scroll nowhere.
