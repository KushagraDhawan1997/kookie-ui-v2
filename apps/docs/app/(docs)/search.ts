/**
 * The search TYPE and the MATCHER — the half that runs in the browser.
 *
 * Split from `search-index.ts` deliberately (2026-08-21). The index is built on the server by
 * reading chapter sources off disk, so that module imports `node:fs`; the palette is a client
 * component and imports the matcher. With both halves in one file the client bundle pulled
 * `node:fs` in through the type import and Turbopack failed the build outright — which is the
 * bundler doing exactly the right thing, and the reason this file exists.
 *
 * Nothing here touches the filesystem, the DOM or React. It is a pure function over data, so
 * it runs identically wherever it is called.
