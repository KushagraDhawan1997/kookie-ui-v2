/**
 * WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH THIS PAGE (2026-09-06, §47; Kushagra: "I see this in every docs site
 * now, especially via mintlify, can you do a bit of research about it, and add them to our
 * toolbar").
 *
 * It was `CopyPage` for the few hours it only copied. The name went when the row did: five
 * controls, of which two copy — a component whose name describes two fifths of it is §26's
 * `TabsTrigger` refusal in a file rather than in an API, and the ecosystem already calls this
 * cluster page actions.
 *
 * The research is in `markdown.ts`, because the twin is where the work is: every destination
 * here is a link carrying one sentence that names a markdown URL, and without that URL the
 * whole pattern is a menu pointing at pages of markup. This file is the doorbell.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES. Two things, both from the same conversation. `Open in v0` is out because v0
 * writes React from a prompt: pointed at a design system's docs it will produce code using our
 * components against a package it has not installed, which is a plausible-looking wrong answer
 * with our name on it. And the copied markdown carries no attribution line — Mintlify injects
 * its own name into what people copy and was called out publicly for it as prompt injection,
 * which is the right name for text that is not the document arriving in an agent's context.
 *
 * NO DROPDOWN, AND THE MARKS ARE THE LABELS (2026-09-06, Kushagra: "Copy age as separate
 * button, and AI logos in a toolbar group, icon button, we dont need dropdown, everyone knows
 * these logos by now").
 *
 * It shipped as the shape every other docs site draws — one attached pill, `Copy Page` beside a
 * chevron, three rows behind it — and that shape is a menu holding three items that never
 * change, on a row with room for three buttons. A disclosure that hides a fixed, tiny, fully
 * legible set is a press spent on nothing. So the destinations stand out on the row, and the
 * argument for it is the same one that lets a control be icon-only anywhere: the mark carries
 * the meaning without the word.
 *
 * TWO CLUSTERS, AND THE SPLIT IS BY WHAT THE CONTROL DOES. Copying puts this page on your
 * clipboard; the marks send it somewhere else. Two `ToolbarGroup`s say that — each track means
 * *these are a set of the same kind* (§45: the segmented control's track with nothing chosen,
 * so the quiet rung arrives with the part) and the gap between them is where the kinds change.
 *
 * NOBODY NEEDS THE WORD (2026-09-06, Kushagra: "Who needs the enite label for copy page, lets
 * just use icon button for it too, in a separate group as it is, but also add a copy link icon
 * button"). `Copy Page` carried the only label on the row, and a label on one control out of
 * five reads as a rank rather than as a name. Every control is a mark now, and each one owes an
 * accessible name and a tooltip in exchange for the word it dropped.
 *
 * The consequence is real and is his call: the row no longer says in words that this feature
 * exists. What answers that is `llms.txt` and the `.md` URLs, which is where the readers this
 * is built for arrive anyway.
 *
 * TWO KINDS OF COPY, and the difference is who the thing is for. The page goes to your
 * clipboard as MARKDOWN, for an agent; the link goes as the ordinary URL, for a person. Same
 * gesture, different artefact, so they sit together and say which is which by their glyph.
 *
 * NO NEW COMPONENT, AND NO `backdrop` HERE EITHER: the band states it once for the whole row,
 * and a region mark reaches every control inside it (§10).
 *
 * THE TOOLTIPS ARE LEGAL NOW. They were refused while the chevron was a `MenuTrigger` — a
 * `TooltipTrigger` around one leaves the menu unanchored (open since 2026-09-06, in the
 * appearance toggle). These are plain links, so the composition that breaks does not exist, and
 * every other icon-only control on this site carries one.
