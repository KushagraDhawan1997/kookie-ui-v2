/**
 * THE WAY BACKWARD AND FORWARD, IN THE BAND (2026-09-07, Kushagra: "add next and previous doc
 * to toolbar, will be buttons not icon buttons").
 *
 * The same two places the page's own footer offers, said at the top as well — a reader who has
 * decided to move on should not have to scroll to the end of the thing they are leaving to do
 * it. The footer pair stays: one is where you arrive when you finish reading, the other is
 * there the whole time.
 *
 * MARKS, IN ONE GROUP (2026-09-07, Kushagra: "make them icon buttons, in one group, use arrow
 * not chevron"). They carried the destination's title for an hour and it cost the band most of
 * its width on a chapter with a long neighbour; every other control in this row is icon-only,
 * and a pair of words among them read as a different kind of thing. The title survives where it
 * costs nothing — in each one's tooltip and its accessible name, so what you are going to is
 * still said, on the press before the press.
 *
 * ARROWS, NOT CHEVRONS, and this repo's own icon file states the difference: an arrow says GO
 * somewhere, a chevron says the next one along. Once the word is gone the glyph carries the
 * whole meaning, and what these do is go.
 *
 * ONE GROUP, because now they are two marks with nothing else to say they belong together —
 * which is the case a track exists for (§45), and the reason the wordy version did not have one.
 *
 * The `ToolbarButton` is what enrols each one in the row's composite — a plain Button in a
 * toolbar is a tab stop the arrow keys never reach.
 *
 * THE LIST COMES FROM THE SERVER, on `PageActions`' own reasoning: reading order is a fact
 * `chapters.ts` already holds, and importing it here would pull every chapter's compiled MDX
 * into the browser to answer a question about two titles. So the chrome hands over the order as
 * data and this file only finds itself in it.
